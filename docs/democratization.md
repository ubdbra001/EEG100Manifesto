# Democratization: the importance of diversity and inclusion to support the development of EEG science
A key challenge for science is to ensure that research primarily benefits everyone rather than a privileged few, and that it is never weaponized to cause intentional harm (Carroll et al., 2020a). Achieving this goal requires democratizing both research outcomes and the people involved—whether they are scientists, participants, or patients. This means creating an environment where research tools, data, and findings are readily accessible and representative of all, free from gender and geopolitical discrimination, and open to international collaborations. It also entails extending opportunities to institutions and researchers in regions experiencing conflict or crises, especially where advanced platforms for basic and clinical research are present.

### 2.1. Diversity in the scientific community
Despite gradual progress, workplace discrimination remains a major issue in science (Woolston, 2021). Enhancing diversity—whether in terms of gender or cultural background—can be both challenging and transformative. Research shows that inclusive teams promote creativity and may even yield stronger scientific outcomes  (Powel 2018; (AlShebli et al., 2018) (Nature collection). Building such teams means not only nurturing an inclusive lab culture, but also ensuring conference participation and networking opportunities reflect a broad range of voices (Corneyllie et al., 2024). 
At the same time, well-intentioned diversity initiatives can unintentionally widen global disparities. When institutions and labs in wealthier countries recruit talented researchers from low- and middle-income regions, they may exacerbate “brain drain,” weakening the scientific capacity of those researchers’ home institutions. The pledges below seek to balance benefits for both parties, encouraging ethically responsible collaboration and mindful engagement with underrepresented communities.

!!! abstract "Pledges"
    - I pledge to continually learn how to recognize and challenge systemic inequities and proactively address social dynamics that may exclude or marginalize colleagues
    - I commit to cultivating a welcoming and inclusive environment where all team members—irrespective of neurodiversity, physical abilities, gender, or ethnicity—feel supported and represented.
    - I commit to following the TRUST code - a global code of conduct for equitable research partnerships - engaging fairly with researchers with fewer resources for research, adapting research methodologies to be culturally appropriate and respectful, ensuring studies are designed with input from the communities involved, avoiding “ethics dumping” (Schroeder et al., 2021), providing training and appropriate authorship credit to collaborators
    - I commit to promoting a more democratic global academic sector by advocating for funding and ethics-review criteria and engaging in practices that expand opportunities for underrepresented and underserved groups—including but not limited to those from low- and middle-income countries, rural areas, indigenous communities, and regions affected by conflict. 
    - I commit to engaging in practices such as distributed and online conferences that foster accessible academic networking and prevent barriers to participation (visa, time commitment, costs, etc.)

### 2.2. Diversity in study participants and sample populations

The field of neuroscience has long relied disproportionately on individuals from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic populations (Caspar, 2024a; Dotson & Duarte, 2020; Henrich, 2020; Muthukrishna et al., 2020). This overreliance narrows the scope of our findings, undermining the goal of identifying universal principles of brain function. Moreover, systematic exclusion of people —whether due to technical constraints in EEG caps (Webb et al., 2022) (Girolamo et al., 2022) entrenched lab practices, or broader structural racism(Parker & Ricard, 2022)—can foster distrust among underrepresented communities and limit the generalizability of research. Crucially, participant diversity should be embraced as a scientifically valuable feature rather than dismissed as “noise.” Recent evidence shows that more inclusive recruitment is not only necessary but also feasible in varied environments, including rural settings in different countries (Caspar, 2024b; Pech et al., 2024), highlighting the potential for creating truly representative and equitable research populations.
!!! abstract "Pledges"
    - I commit to attempting to recruit as diverse samples of experiment participants as possible given the study goals, with special attention to gender and ethnoracial representation
    - I commit to train myself and my team to include everyone, regardless of the hair styles and to never use hair styles or other physical aspects as a direct exclusion criteria.
    - I commit to engaging with minority communities actively
    - I commit to paying attention to cultural sensitivities, addressing stigma in brain research, and histories of marginalization 
    - I support adapting my experimental equipment (EEG head caps…) to account for potential individual differences, obtaining informed consent in ways that are understandable and meaningful to participants, respecting local customs, languages and ethics
    - I commit to include a Constraints of Generalizability (CoG) section to provide a clearer understanding of the findings’ generalizability, which is crucial for interpretation and replication (Caspar, 2024, Simons et al., 2017)
    - I support exploring and sharing qualitative epistemology to establish barriers and facilitators to taking part in under-represented groups
    - I commit to utilise or develop templates that ensure consistent reporting of demographic information and keep records of sample diversity across studies to assess progress and identify areas for improvement.

### 2.3. Accessibility of research outcomes

Ensuring that research outcomes—whether new knowledge or potential applications—remain accessible to both the scientific community and the general public is a core ethical responsibility. The rise of the open science movement has substantially advanced this goal, aided by open-source software and hardware, DIY (“do-it-yourself”) materials, open knowledge platforms (e.g., Wikipedia), open data repositories, open-access publications, and a wealth of instructional content on video platforms. Underpinned by legal frameworks (e.g., copyleft) and data use agreements that prevent misappropriation or misuse, these initiatives foster transparency and collaboration within clear regulatory boundaries.
However, meaningful access must also address the inverse care law, by which those who most need healthcare—including improved brain health—are often least likely to receive it (World Health Statistics). Expanding access to research tools, knowledge, and resources can help reduce inequalities in care, as well as bolster participant diversity (see pledges 2.2) and promote equitable cross-community collaborations (see pledges 2.1). By prioritizing widespread availability, we can ensure that EEG research benefits the broadest spectrum of society, particularly those who stand to gain the most.

!!! abstract "Pledges"
    - I commit to using open and transparent approaches (e.g., preprints, preregistration) responsibly, and to withdrawing deposits that do not yield validated findings or conclusive outcomes.
    - Where my research has potential for wider benefit, I pledge to develop publicly accessible summaries or visuals of my findings to make the results (and their limitations) understandable and beneficial to broader, non-specialist audiences.
    - I commit to using research results to inform policies and investments that target health inequalities and under-resourced areas, ensuring that EEG applications reach communities where they are needed most.
