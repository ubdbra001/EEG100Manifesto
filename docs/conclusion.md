## Conclusion
??? quote "Outline"
    The challenges outlined here underscore that EEG science must evolve responsibly, balancing innovation with ethical, social, and environmental considerations. As individuals and as a community, we share the duty to anticipate potential misuses, curb unsustainable practices, and embrace virtuous approaches. Yet even with the best intentions, unintended or adverse outcomes—sometimes called rebound effects—remain a constant possibility. Staying alert to these risks, seeking continual improvement, and adapting based on new insights are all crucial steps in ensuring that our efforts genuinely ‘do good.’

    A significant part of meeting these responsibilities lies in embracing Open Science and FAIR principles. By pre-registering studies, openly sharing data and code, and using transparent publication outlets, we can foster reproducibility, collaboration, and equitable access to scientific knowledge. This inclusivity will strengthen the entire field, broadening impact and accelerating discovery.

    By signing onto this manifesto and adopting its principles in your daily practice, you contribute to a future where EEG research is not only more robust and sustainable but also firmly rooted in ethical and equitable engagement. Each pledge is a step toward maximizing EEG’s societal benefits—ensuring it advances knowledge, improves well-being, and respects the planet and its people.
