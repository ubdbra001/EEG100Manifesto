## Responsibility: considering societal impacts, issues of equity, and sustainability. 

EEG research typically uses relatively few consumables and relies on less resource-intensive electronics than many other domains, which can make it appear innocuous by comparison. However, the growing affordability of EEG devices and their entrance into consumer markets raise potential concerns regarding societal, technological, and environmental impacts. As a community, we share the responsibility of examining these wider implications—extending beyond our immediate scientific interests and core practices—in order to inspire responsible use and set an example for other fields facing similar challenges.

### Societal and technological responsibility
#### 3.1. Ethical use of EEG. 
??? quote "Outline"
    Conversations around ethical accountability for scientific discoveries and their real-world applications have a long history, extending beyond the scientific community itself. Each research field faces distinct risks and benefits, and EEG is no exception. In particular, EEG has been explored for sensitive or potentially sensitive uses, such as detecting “concealed information” (Wolpe et al., 2005)(Wolpe et al. 2005, Rosenfeld 2005, Farwell 2012), enabling implicit interaction outside the participant’s awareness (Fairclough, 2017; Krol et al., 2020; Zander et al., 2016), and launching so-called “side-channel attacks” that decode private data like PIN codes (Lange et al., 2018). Collectively, these applications demonstrate the capacity of EEG to decode—and possibly influence—a person’s brain activity, heightening concerns about individual privacy (Mecacci & Haselager, 2019), mental integrity (Ienca & Andorno, 2017), and broader social equity (Hyman, 2011).

    Researchers must carefully evaluate their work’s potential societal impacts, including how future developments may build on today’s findings. Although many EEG studies cite adherence to the Declaration of Helsinki, that document largely focuses on medical research, leaving gaps for more general EEG practices. Current legal discussions (e.g., Yuste, 2021; Muhl, 2024) and best-practice recommendations (Niso, 2022) underscore the importance of addressing EEG-specific ethical considerations. Meanwhile, the increasing integration of AI in EEG (e.g., automated signal classification, neural decoding) amplifies risks of inaccurate interpretations, overgeneralizations, and bias (Birhane et al., 2024; Bolte & van Wynsberghe, 2024). Beyond the Declaration of Helsinki, researchers can consult the CARE framework for responsible AI use, which emphasizes pre-specifying verifiable quality criteria—correctness, logical consistency, and relevance—and employing human judgment to verify outputs. This additional scrutiny is crucial for preventing AI-driven misinterpretations, especially in contexts like cognitive probing or lie detection.

    Multiple organizations offer further guidance: UNESCO's reports on neurotechnology ethics  and the OECD’s recommendations on responsible innovation in neurotechnology provide foundational strategies to safeguard privacy and autonomy, including in areas such as brain fingerprinting or generative AI  (Knoechel et al., 2024). The NeuroRights Foundation likewise advocates treating neural data as highly sensitive and recommends technical protections like encryption and differential privacy to avert misuse  (Yuste, 2023). Taken together, these measures illustrate the growing consensus that EEG researchers must proactively address both the near-term ethical challenges and the longer-term implications of their work.

#### 3.2. Relation to technology
??? quote "Outline"
    Our fascination with advanced, cutting-edge instrumentation (Nielsen & Andersen, 2022) can make projects that feature state-of-the-art hardware seem inherently more compelling. Yet focusing solely on acquiring newer devices may overlook the importance of fair career development and cultivating expertise in areas like data quality control and open science. EEG research, in particular, benefits from easy-to-repair, shareable, or open hardware, given the method’s relatively lower infrastructural demands compared to other neuroimaging techniques 

    By prioritizing resilience over novelty—such as defining long-term sustainability plans, pooling resource-intensive tools, and collaborating with hardware manufacturers—we can strike a better balance between investing in human capital and in equipment. This strategy not only encourages more equitable and innovative research but can also contribute to ensuring a sustainable future for EEG science.

    - I commit to foster collaboration by sharing high-cost EEG tools, across labs and institutions, reducing waste and increasing efficiency in research.

#### 3.3. Research evaluation. 
??? quote "Outline"
    There are growing concerns about the criteria used to evaluate scientific projects and the promises made in relation to them. Many assessment bodies still rely on narrow metrics—such as journal impact factor or h-index—that fail to capture the breadth and nuance of academic careers. Such a focus discourages interdisciplinary, collaborative, and open-science approaches.

    Adopting broader research evaluation procedures and metrics, as recommended by the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA), is key to creating a more open, equitable, and ethically grounded research culture. Criteria that value transparency, data sharing, and open-source development can strengthen the robustness, reliability, and social relevance of scientific findings. Embracing these more comprehensive measures can help foster integrity, encourage collaboration, and ultimately benefit both the scientific community and society at large.

    - I commit to encouraging assessment criteria that prioritize open practices (data sharing, preregistration, code release) and value multidisciplinary teamwork
    - I commit to advocating for and implementing assessment frameworks (e.g., those proposed by CoARA) that emphasize integrity, inclusivity, and social impact alongside scientific excellence.
    - I commit to continually reviewing and refining evaluation metrics within my sphere of influence—whether as a grant reviewer, hiring committee member, or collaborator—and to pushing for broader acceptance of open, ethical, and diversified research practices.

### Environmental responsibility
#### 3.4 Reconsidering Environmental Impact 
??? quote "Outline"
    The scientific consensus is clear: human activity, including scientific research, profoundly affects Earth’s climate and resources—posing a serious threat to humanity’s future. Scientists, positioned at the forefront of knowledge, have a duty not just to document this crisis but also to alter their research practices accordingly (Aron et al., 2020; Racimo et al., 2022; C. L. Rae et al., 2022; Urai & Kelly, 2023). Although EEG and related neuroscience fields may appear less resource-intensive than many other domains, we are still part of a broader infrastructure that depends on finite materials, substantial energy, and complex global supply chains.

    Some lines of EEG research offer potential long-term benefits for human health and well-being, but they can also require large-scale computation, extensive travel, or high-end equipment. Sustaining such work without critically evaluating environmental costs risks perpetuating a “do it because we can” mentality—may be untenable in the long run. Moreover, systemic pressures in academia, such as publication demands and grant requirements, may push researchers to pursue expansions in scope without equivalent scrutiny of environmental impact. Achieving genuine sustainability will require confronting these norms, ensuring that EEG studies are not only scientifically rigorous but also responsive to the realities of climate change and resource scarcity.

!!! abstract "Pledges"
    - I commit to advocating for ethical regulations and policies that require serious consideration of environmental impact—especially for high-resource or energy-intensive studies. 
    - Before beginning large or computationally demanding projects, I commit to weighing potential short- and long-term environmental costs against any projected benefits, avoiding purely curiosity-driven studies that lack meaningful societal or scientific value.
    - I pledge to remain mindful of how academia’s incentive structures can undermine sustainability goals. I will strive to foster discussions, both within my lab and in broader networks, about rethinking these systemic norms.
    - I commit to prioritizing or designing research programs that have a clearly defined path toward tangible, long-term societal or environmental benefits rather than short-lived or insular academic gains.
    - I will not treat EEG or my specific field as inherently exempt from sustainability concerns. My research is part of a larger, resource-intensive system; I acknowledge my role within that system and strive to minimize its negative impacts.
    - In addition to reducing my own research footprint, I commit to cultivating a “climate handshake,” using my position to influence others positively—whether that means introducing sustainable measures in my department, mentoring students on responsible research practices, or partnering with like-minded groups to effect broader change.

#### 3.5 Measuring and reducing the environmental footprint of our work 
??? quote "Outline"
    While EEG itself generally has a moderate ecological impact, the datasets involved can be very large, and the required storage and computational power used to support EEG sciences continue to expand. Moreover, we need to account for the broader environmental footprint of our professional activities (e.g., conference travel, institutional purchases, and overall infrastructure; see Souter et al., 2024, for similar initiative in fMRI).

    A key first step is to quantify this impact (see tools examples below). With that knowledge in hand, researchers can identify effective measures to reduce negative outcomes while preserving core scientific aims. However, backfire effects—where well-intentioned actions produce unintended harm—must be carefully monitored to ensure that measures to reduce our carbon footprint do not inadvertently lead to other adverse consequences

!!! abstract "Pledges"
    - I pledge to minimize the environmental impact of my research through sustainable practices across multiple domains. This includes responsible data management, such as archiving datasets efficiently to reduce redundancy and prioritizing cloud-based services powered by renewable energy. 
    - I will advocate for virtual conferences, workshops, and meetings to reduce travel-related emissions while promoting hybrid formats for inclusivity and accessibility. 
    - I pledge to reserve air travel for young researchers who need it the most to launch their careers and build their network.
    - I commit to using energy-efficient algorithms, optimizing computational methods to reduce runtime and energy consumption, and scheduling resource-intensive analyses during off-peak energy hours where feasible. 
    - I will evaluate the environmental impact of my laboratory and research projects by quantifying emissions, energy usage, and waste production through available tools, and use these evaluations to guide more sustainable practices in daily operations and long-term planning.
    - I will critically evaluate my own research projects and consider renouncing to run a project if it does not lead to foreseeable future benefits.

#### 3.6 Using research resources, equipment and data thoughtfully
??? quote "Outline"
    While non-invasive EEG often appears low-impact compared to more resource-intensive methods, individual projects can still consume substantial time, funding, and materials—particularly if their design is inefficient or redundant. Consequently, reviewing existing datasets and clarifying genuine methodological advances before embarking on new recordings are essential steps to ensure our collective use of participant time and laboratory resources remains both ethical and environmentally sound. By being judicious about data collection, we both respect our participants and optimize the use of laboratory, computational, and environmental resources.

    Further, the production and disposal of scientific equipment contribute significantly to pollution and waste. Encouraging equipment pooling, sharing, and reuse reduces the demand for new devices and extends the lifespan of existing ones. Mega-analyses—where multiple teams aggregate already-collected datasets—also decrease resource usage, strengthen collaboration, and foster more reliable findings (Koile & Cristia, 2021).  By reducing resource usage and waste production, we not only lessen our environmental impact but also encourage a more collaborative and cost-effective research environment.

    Likewise, our field generates vast volumes of data, and we bear a responsibility to make sure they are fully utilized. To facilitate sharing and reuse, it is essential to standardize data acquisition and analysis and to manage data according to the FAIR principles (Wilkinson, 2016), ensuring that it remains Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. (See also Section 1.2.)

!!! abstract "Pledges"
    - I commit to reviewing existing datasets and reusing previously collected or open data whenever feasible and only collecting new EEG data if it provides novel insights, significantly improves upon current methodologies, or addresses a well-defined research gap—thereby respecting participants’ time, minimizing resource use, and fostering more sustainable, ethical EEG science.
    - Encourage collaboration across labs to share facilities and optimize resource utilization - from headsets to high performance clusters.
    - Establish and participate in equipment-sharing networks or consortia that facilitate access to specialized instruments.
    - Advocate for manufacturers to support sustainable practices by providing long-term support, repair services, and recycling programs for their equipment.
    - Select EEG equipment based on durability and ability to repair, promote practices that extend the life of equipment, such as regular maintenance, repairs, and upgrades, rather than immediate replacement.
