# Glossary

**Deontological (Deontology)**
:   An ethical framework centered on duties, rules, and moral obligations rather than outcomes alone. In the context of EEG research, a deontological approach emphasizes adhering to principled standards—such as respecting participant autonomy, ensuring data integrity, and minimizing harm—regardless of whether certain shortcuts or less rigorous practices might yield faster results or greater convenience. This commitment to following moral rules helps guide responsible decision-making at each stage of the research process.

**Scientific Integrity**
:   Upholding rigorous, honest, and transparent research practices. Scientific integrity encompasses maintaining high methodological standards, avoiding biases or questionable practices, and sharing findings responsibly. It also includes acknowledging limitations and uncertainties, ensuring reproducibility, and treating collaborators and participants ethically.

**Sustainability**
:   Meeting present needs without depleting resources or compromising future possibilities. Within EEG research, sustainability involves minimizing environmental impact—from equipment production to data storage—and ensuring that the benefits of EEG science do not come at an unacceptable ecological or social cost. A sustainable approach balances scientific advancement with planetary limits and intergenerational equity.

**Diversity**
:   Embracing a broad range of backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences in both research teams and participant samples. Diversity in EEG research includes attending to differences in gender, ethnicity, geographical context, socioeconomic status, and neurodiversity. By actively removing barriers and ensuring equitable representation, diversity fosters creativity, strengthens the validity of findings, and promotes inclusive scientific progress.

**BCI (Brain-Computer Interface)**
:   A system that enables direct communication between a person’s brain signals and external devices or computers. In EEG-based BCIs, scalp electrodes detect brain activity, which specialized software translates into commands for controlling assistive technologies or other applications.

**Open Science**
:   A movement promoting transparency, accessibility, and reproducibility in research. Open Science practices include publicly sharing data, code, and protocols; publishing in open-access journals; and using collaborative platforms to foster inclusive and ethical research.

**FAIR Principles**
:   An acronym for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. Data and resources adhering to FAIR principles enable efficient discovery, integration, and reuse by both humans and machines, thereby accelerating scientific progress and reliability.

**CARE Principles**
:   Stands for Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics. Initially framed for Indigenous Data Governance, these principles also apply to broader AI and neurotechnology contexts, emphasizing ethical data stewardship that respects communal rights and benefits.

**Predatory Journals**
:   Publications that exploit academic needs for rapid dissemination while providing little to no peer review or editorial oversight. Often characterized by hidden fees, aggressive solicitation, and low-quality content, these journals threaten scientific credibility and the integrity of the scholarly record.

**Diamond Open Access**
:   A form of open-access publishing in which neither authors nor readers pay fees. Instead, costs are supported by institutions, grants, or other funding models. Diamond OA aims to reduce financial barriers and promote equitable dissemination of knowledge.

**Neurofeedback**
:   A therapeutic or training approach using real-time displays of EEG or other neurophysiological signals. Participants attempt to self-regulate brain patterns to improve cognitive or affective states. Despite its promise, rigorous, peer-reviewed evidence of efficacy is often lacking or inconsistent.

**Ethics Dumping**
:   The practice of exporting unethical or substandard research methods to regions with weaker regulatory frameworks or limited oversight. It often exploits vulnerable populations, ignoring robust ethical standards required in the researchers’ own jurisdictions.

**Brain Drain**
:   The emigration or recruitment of highly skilled individuals from lower-resource regions (e.g., LMICs) to wealthier institutions. Although it can offer personal benefits to those recruited, it may deplete local capacity and reinforce global inequities in research and innovation.

**Systemic Bias**
:   Enduring patterns of advantage or disadvantage tied to characteristics such as race, gender, or socioeconomic status. In research, systemic bias can skew participant pools, career trajectories, and resource allocation, undermining fairness and validity.

**“Climate Handshake”**
:   A concept referring to an individual’s commitment to use their position and influence to encourage more sustainable practices within their research community—fostering a ripple effect that extends beyond personal decisions.

**Epistemological Rigor**
:   The principle of grounding research in well-justified theories and methods, clarifying not just how the research is done but why. Epistemological rigor ensures the interpretive framework is robust, reducing the risk of spurious conclusions and guiding meaningful inquiry.

**Rebound Effect**
:   An unintended negative consequence of an action meant to be beneficial. In the context of sustainability, a rebound effect might occur when a supposedly “green” measure drives additional consumption or unforeseen ecological harm.

**Data Encryption & Differential Privacy**
:   Technical methods for protecting sensitive information. Encryption encodes data so only authorized parties can read it, while differential privacy introduces controlled noise to datasets, preserving patterns at a group level while obscuring individual details.
