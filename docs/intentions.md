    For a century, electroencephalography (EEG) has been a cornerstone of neuroscience. Today, more than ever, we—scientists, engineers, artists, and clinicians—are witnessing unprecedented advances in recording technology. Modern EEG devices are increasingly affordable, robust, and portable, extending their reach well beyond clinical diagnostics and traditional research labs. At the same time, global computing power, cloud communication, and machine learning—now coupled with generative AI—promise ever more sophisticated analyses and real-time brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), making their widespread adoption seem not just possible, but inevitable.

    Yet these rapid technological advances bring significant challenges. A reproducibility crisis in science has eroded trust in established findings (Button et al., 2013; Collaboration, 2015; Höller et al., 2017; Ioannidis, 2005; Pavlov et al., 2021). Meanwhile, major societal concerns—such as climate change, global inequality, misinformation, and escalating military conflicts—threaten research by constraining material resources and political priorities (C. Rae et al., 2022; Urai & Kelly, 2023). Taken together, these pressures highlight the urgent need to revisit ethical standards and implement best practices for sustainable research involving human participants.

    EEG’s growing role in research and clinical contexts—and its likely expansion into consumer markets—also demands careful consideration of diverse applications and potential impacts [mental privacy, corporate greed/exploitation, manipulation misinformation]. Accordingly, this document serves as a manifesto: a starting point for building a deontological framework for EEG science. It reflects our collective commitment to ethical and responsible practices, offering viewpoints on scientific integrity, accessibility, accountability, and the broader social and environmental implications of EEG research. By examining these issues, we hope to foster meaningful and conscientious scientific progress.

    Although this manifesto centers on EEG, we expect that its core themes might resonate across neuroimaging, and perhaps even science at large. A key driving force behind the new potential and renewed excitement of EEG comes from the increase in the availability and robustness of portable systems (Hinrichs et al., 2020; Marini et al., 2019; Niso et al., 2023a; Radüntz, 2018). Colleagues working with Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) (e.g. (Burns et al., 2019)) and perhaps soon magnetoencephalography (MEG) (e.g. (Boto et al., 2017; Schofield et al., 2024) might also find themselves in a similar situation and may find these reflections relevant to their own fields. They are welcome to join this initiative or may prefer to develop similar approaches within their communities. 

    Each section below includes a list of commitments that you, as an individual, lab group, association, or organization can subscribe to. This manifesto is addressed to the entire EEG community, including technicians, engineers, PhD students, post-docs, senior researchers, research project evaluators, research administrators, and scientific decision-makers. It invites each individual to reflect and commit to specific pledges, tailored to their role and responsibilities within the community. Signatories can thus personalize their commitment by subscribing only to the points that they deem relevant. There will be some general principles that we will all agree upon, but there will also be some more controversial points that are likely to generate healthy discussion.

    Ultimately, a manifesto’s value is measured not by its wording or by how many people sign it, but by the concrete actions it inspires. We urge you to consider these proposals in the context of your own work and to discuss them with your peers. Where these commitments resonate, share them with your colleagues and incorporate them into your lab procedures and/or daily practice. The extent of your individual commitment will naturally vary according to your interests, expertise, and available resources—but each positive step can help shape a more robust, responsible, and inclusive future for EEG science.

??? info "Context"

    Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique for measuring the electrical activity of the brain. In the 100 years since its discovery (Mushtaq et al., 2024), EEG has proven to be a valuable tool for a range of clinical applications, from diagnosing and monitoring brain disorders (including epilepsy (ref), encephalopathies (ref), sleep disorders (ref), impaired auditory processing (Thompson et al., 2001), disorders of consciousness/vigilance and coma (Casali et al., 2013), and brain injuries (ref) to tracking the progress of treatments (ref). Furthermore, clinical applications have been proposed in dementing disorders, such as Alzheimer’s and related diseases (Babiloni et al., 2021; Ehrenberg et al., 2023). In the basic research domain, EEG has revealed attributes about a range of cognitive functions, including (but not limited to) perception, attention, memory, decision-making, and language processing (Hari & Puce, 2023). EEG is also an increasingly important method used in assistive technology (e.g., BCI)(Bastos-Filho, 2020). 
    
    Today, EEG is already one of the most widely used functional neuroimaging tools. The increasing portability and decreasing cost of modern devices (Niso et al., 2023b) might further scale-up its application. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI; (Altaheri et al., 2023), robotics, and computing are also opening up new opportunities for integration with the next generation of wearable and assistive technologies (Bastos-Filho, 2020; Cincotti et al., 2008). EEG can be easily combined with other physiological data, e.g., electrocardiogram (ECG), electromyogram (EMG), electrogastrogram (EGG), and electrodermal activity (EDA), which offer complimentary windows to understand brain dynamics. EEG can also be effectively combined with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to benefit from high-spatial and temporal resolutions in brain imaging (e.g. Warbrick, 2022).  From its technical and theoretical peculiarities, [if being rolled out to a much wider user base] EEG has [could have] enormous potential for transforming lives, beyond its current applications. For example, it could help develop new diagnostic tools and treatment strategies, as well as assistive technologies improving brain health and healthy aging (but see also  Forest, 2022 for a discussion on the limits of these endeavors). For society at large, it could usher in a new wave of human-machine interaction, making various occupations safer, and less demanding. 
    
    But great promises and grand ambitions also bring challenges and responsibilities that must be addressed to maximize current scientific and human investments (Niso, Krol, et al., 2022a). In the following, we highlight what we perceive as the most pressing issues in three domains: Scientific integrity and epistemological rigor are two aspects of our practice that require continuous attention (Button et al., 2013; Ioannidis, 2005). As scientific practices evolve alongside new technologies, it is essential to ensure that existing methods remain valid while continuously improving them. Our focus should be on fostering robust, reproducible, open, and participatory science. Democratization of the scientific process is another important aspect, we need to embrace diversity at all stages of the research process, from participants to scientists conducting experiments, as well as those impacted by the findings. This diversity enriches the scientific process by bringing in broader perspectives, leading to more innovative, widely relevant, and robust outcomes, ensuring that scientific practices are more inclusive, ethical, trusted and understood by the communities impacted by the findings. Finally, and perhaps most controversially, we pledge for technological responsibility, acknowledging the limitations of the hardware and processing methods, and their potential misuse. We need to acknowledge that not everything that is doable is desirable (Moor, 2005) and should carefully examine the ethical legitimacy of our research lines, considering the social and material impacts of any research project or discovery.
