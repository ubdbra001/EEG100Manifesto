## Introduction

This document is a starting point for **building a deontological framework for EEG science** and upgrading our practices accordingly. It aims to outline the standards we believe are essential to collectively maximize the positive impact of EEG research for society. It is a call to action, to encourage critical reflection on the broader consequences of scientific research while sharing emerging alternatives.

In the following, we highlight what we perceive as the most pressing issues across three domains: (i) **scientific integrity and epistemological rigor**; (ii) **Democratization**; and (iii) **technological and environmental responsibility**.

**Scientific integrity and epistemological rigor** are two aspects of our practice that require continuous attention ([Button et al., 2013](references.md#Button2013); [Ioannidis, 2005](references.md#Ioannidis2005)). As scientific practices evolve alongside new technologies, it is essential to ensure that existing methods remain valid while continuously improving them to avoid methodological flaws that can lead to biased, false, irreplicable findings. Our focus should be on fostering robust, reproducible, open, and participatory science. 

**Democratization of the scientific process:** We need to embrace the diversity of agents and subjects at all stages of the research process, from scientists conducting experiments to study participants, as well as the people impacted by the findings. Diversity in the participant populations supports generalizable and ethical scientific findings, and diversity in applications and outreach makes our research accessible, relevant, and beneficial to a broader range of communities, engaging more diverse audiences. Thus, diversity enriches the scientific process by bringing in broader perspectives [(Phillips et al., 2009)](references.md#Phillips2009), leading to more innovative, widely relevant, and robust outcomes, ensuring that scientific practices are more inclusive, ethical, trusted and understood by the communities impacted by the findings. 

Finally, and perhaps most controversially, we pledge for **technological and environmental responsibility**, acknowledging the limitations of the hardware and processing methods, and their potential misuse**.** We need to acknowledge that not everything that is doable is desirable [(Moor, 2005)](references.md#Moor2005) and should carefully examine the ethical legitimacy of our research lines, considering the social and material impacts of any research project or discovery. These are key aspects for cognition research, not solely for ethical reasons, but because cognition is produced and shaped by biological, social, environmental, technological, and cultural dynamics [(Newen et al., 2018)](references.md#Newen2018).

Each section below includes a list of commitments that you, as an individual, lab group, association, or organization can support. This manifesto is addressed to the *entire* EEG community, including technicians, engineers, PhD students, post-docs, senior researchers, research project evaluators, research administrators, artists, collaborators, and scientific decision-makers. It invites each individual to reflect on the raised topics, tailored to their role and responsibilities within the community. There will be some general principles that we will all agree upon, but there will no doubt be some more controversial points that we hope will generate healthy discussion. Feel free to use the [CuttingEEG forum](https://forum.cuttingeeg.org/invites/TFWQZX1pBa){:target="_blank"} for this purpose. **We invite you to sign all or parts** of this manifesto **and share it** with your community if you broadly agree with the initiative.

### Electroencephalography

For a century, electroencephalography (EEG) has been a cornerstone of neuroscience ([Mushtaq et al. 2024](references.md#Mushtaq2024);  [Hari & Puce, 2023)](references.md#Hari2023)). Today, more than ever, we—scientists, engineers and clinicians—are witnessing unprecedented advances in recording technology and analysis methods. Modern EEG devices are increasingly affordable, robust, and portable, extending their reach well beyond clinical diagnostics and traditional research labs. At the same time, global computing power, cloud communication, and machine learning—now coupled with generative AI—promise ever more sophisticated analyses and real-time brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), making their widespread adoption seem not just possible, but inevitable.

However, these rapid technological advances bring significant challenges. A reproducibility crisis in science has eroded trust in established findings ([Button et al., 2013](references.md#Button2013); [Collaboration, 2015](references.md#OSC2015); [Höller et al., 2017](references.md#Holler2017); [Ioannidis, 2005](references.md#Ioannidis2005); [Pavlov et al., 2021](references.md#Pavlov2021)). Meanwhile, major societal concerns—including climate change, global inequality, growing obscurantism and escalating military conflicts—threaten research by constraining material resources and political priorities ([Rae et al., 2022](references.md#Rae2022); [Urai & Kelly, 2023](references.md#Urai2023)). Taken together, these pressures highlight the need to take stock and reflect on our ethical standards and implement best practices for sustainable research involving human participants.

Grand ambitions inevitably bring significant challenges and responsibilities that must be navigated to ensure both scientific progress and societal benefit [(Niso, Krol, et al., 2022)](references.md#Niso2022b). For instance, even the most advanced brain imaging methods cannot answer all questions in cognitive science ([Forest 2013](references.md#Forest2013), [2022](references.md#Forest2022)) and EEG of course also has its specific limits. In clinical contexts, while EEG might be able to inform diagnosis and guide treatment, it should never displace the primacy of human caregivers. Beyond research and medicine, the broader application of EEG technology introduces pressing ethical and practical dilemmas. Scaling EEG for mass-market use would demand high-volume manufacturing, amplifying environmental burdens. At the same time, over-dependence on EEG-based tools risks fostering cognitive complacency—outsourcing functions we should cultivate, rather than merely augmenting them.

### This Manifesto

Ultimately, a manifesto’s value is measured not by its wording or by how many people sign it, but by the concrete actions it inspires. We urge you to consider these proposals in the context of your own work and to discuss them with your peers. Where these commitments resonate, incorporate them into your lab procedures and/or daily practice and share them with your colleagues. The extent of your individual commitment will naturally vary according to your interests, expertise, and available resources—but each positive step can help shape a more robust, responsible, and inclusive future for EEG science.

Although this manifesto centres on EEG, we expect that its core themes might resonate across neuroimaging, and perhaps even science at large. A key driving force behind the new potential and renewed excitement of EEG comes from the increase in the availability and robustness of portable systems ([Hinrichs et al., 2020](references.md#Hinrichs2020); [Marini et al., 2019](references.md#Marini2019); [Niso et al., 2023](references.md#Niso2023); [Radüntz, 2018](references.md#Raduntz2018)). Colleagues working with Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) (e.g. [(Burns et al., 2019)](references.md#Burns2019)) and perhaps soon magnetoencephalography (MEG) (e.g. [Boto et al., 2017](references.md#Boto2017); [Schofield et al., 2024](references.md#Schofield2024)) might also find themselves in a similar situation and may find these reflections relevant to their own fields. They are welcome to join this initiative or may prefer to develop similar approaches within their communities.
