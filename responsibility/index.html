  <h1>Responsibility</h1>

<h2 id="responsibility-considering-societal-impacts-issues-of-equity-and-sustainability">Responsibility: considering societal impacts, issues of equity, and sustainability.</h2>
<p>EEG's non-invasive nature makes it a seemingly harmless technology, but beneath this benign facade lie complex questions that warrant careful consideration. The steady progress in neurotechnology makes it important to carefully examine the implications of foreseeable uses. Further, although technological advancement itself continually unlocks new possibilities, this very fact simultaneously shapes how we understand and inquire about the world, and should not obscure the original purpose of science. </p>
<p>EEG research typically uses relatively few consumables and less resource-intensive electronics than many other domains, making it seem innocuous by comparison. However, the growing affordability of EEG devices and their expansion into consumer markets could turn this advantage into a challenge if we overlook its broader impact and possible rebound effects. We share the responsibility of examining these wider implications—beyond our immediate scientific interests and practices—to encourage responsible use.</p>
<h3 id="societal-and-technological-responsibility">Societal and technological responsibility</h3>
<p>Applications of EEG research are potentially far reaching, and potential misuses should not be overlooked.</p>
<details class="info">
<summary>3.1. Ethical use of EEG</summary>
<p>Conversations around ethical accountability for scientific discoveries and their real-world applications have a long history, extending beyond the scientific community itself. Each research field faces distinct risks and benefits, and EEG is no exception. In particular, EEG has been explored for sensitive or potentially sensitive uses, such as detecting “concealed information” (<a href="../references/#Farwell2012">Farwell, 2012</a>; <a href="../references/#Rosenfeld2005">Rosenfeld, 2005</a>; <a href="../references/#Wolpe2005">Wolpe et al., 2005</a>), enabling implicit interaction outside the participant’s awareness (<a href="../references/#Fairclough2017">Fairclough, 2017</a>; <a href="../references/#Krol2020">Krol et al., 2020</a>; <a href="../references/#Zander2016">Zander et al., 2016</a>), and launching so-called “side-channel attacks” that decode private data like PIN codes <a href="../references/#Lange2018">(Lange et al., 2018)</a>. Together, these applications demonstrate the capacity of EEG to decode—and possibly influence—a person’s brain activity, heightening concerns about individual privacy <a href="../references/#Mecacci2019">(Mecacci &amp; Haselager, 2019)</a>, mental integrity <a href="../references/#Ienca2017">(Ienca &amp; Andorno, 2017)</a>, and broader social equity <a href="../references/#Hyman2011">(Hyman, 2011)</a>.</p>
<p>Researchers must carefully evaluate their work’s potential societal impacts, including how future developments may build on today’s findings. Although many EEG studies cite adherence to the Declaration of Helsinki, that document largely focuses on medical research, leaving gaps for more general EEG practices. Current legal discussions (e.g. <a href="../references/#Muhl2024">Muhl, 2024</a>; <a href="../references/#Yuste2023">Yuste, 2023</a>) and best-practice recommendations <a href="../references/#Niso2022b">(Niso, Krol, et al., 2022)</a> underscore the importance of addressing EEG-specific ethical considerations. Meanwhile, the increasing integration of ML/AI in EEG (e.g., automated signal classification, neural decoding) amplifies risks of inaccurate interpretations, overgeneralizations, and bias (<a href="../references/#Birhane2024">Birhane et al., 2024</a>; <a href="../references/#Bolte2024">Bolte &amp; van Wynsberghe, 2024</a>). Beyond the Declaration of Helsinki, therefore, researchers and developers of EEG-based neurotechnology should look both at more generic frameworks concerning the use of personal data, automated decision-making, and AI, and at more specific guidelines concerning aspects directly related to neurotechnology, like <a href="https://neurorightsfoundation.org/" target="_blank">neurorights</a>. The former can guide the researcher, for example, in specifying verifiable quality criteria ahead of time and ensuring proper oversight, whereas the latter can aid in the evaluation of specific solutions, among other things.</p>
<p>A variety of organisations offer further guidance, both generic and specific. <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/ethics-neurotech" target="_blank">UNESCO's reports on neurotechnology ethics</a>  and the <a href="https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/oecd-legal-0457" target="_blank">OECD’s recommendations on responsible innovation in neurotechnology</a> provide foundational strategies to safeguard privacy and autonomy, including in areas such as brain fingerprinting or generative AI <a href="../references/#Knoechel2024">(Knoechel et al., 2024)</a>. The <a href="https://neurorightsfoundation.org/" target="_blank">NeuroRights Foundation</a> likewise advocates treating neural data as highly sensitive and recommends technical protections like encryption and differential privacy to avert misuse <a href="../references/#Yuste2023">(Yuste, 2023)</a>. Taken together, these measures illustrate the growing consensus that EEG researchers must proactively address both the near-term ethical challenges and the longer-term implications of their work.</p>

<summary>3.2. Overestimating technology</summary>
<p>New research technologies and analysis methods can correct shortcomings of previous tools, enable new observations and crucially progress our understanding of the brain; hence, tool development is a cornerstone of contemporary neuroscience.</p>
<p>However, there can also be hype dynamics, and possibly cruel optimism <a href="../references/#Berlant2011">(Berlant, 2011)</a>, as our fascination with advanced, cutting-edge instrumentation can make projects that feature such tools seem inherently more compelling and worthwhile <a href="../references/#Nielsen2022">(Nielsen &amp; Andersen, 2022)</a>. Similar to the current fascination of the general public with neuroscientific explanations <a href="../references/#Weisberg2008">(Weisberg, 2008)</a> and brain imaging <a href="../references/#McCabe2008">(McCabe &amp; Castel, 2018)</a>, we should also see the risks of such biases, though - hypes fade, and only time will tell how sustainable a progress was made.</p>
<p>New tools should be developed, and when they are they must be validated and tested out. The governing thought when deciding for a particular tool in empirical research, however, should be <em>scientific progress</em> rather than mere aesthetics or business.</p>
<p>Blindly adapting new tools and abandoning established techniques might even have negative consequences: For example, powerful ML tools can progress a relative devaluation of theory (see Section 1). Focusing on new recording devices may counteract the importance of fair career development and cultivating expertise in data quality control and open science. Furthermore, adopting new tools is resource intensive, which might reproduce global inequalities (see Democratization) and create problems in terms of ecological sustainability (see following Section).</p>
<p>Given its relatively low-tech nature, EEG research can particularly benefit from easy-to-repair, shareable, or open hardware, if we as a field resist this urge. By prioritizing resilience over novelty—such as defining long-term sustainability plans, pooling resource-intensive tools, and collaborating with hardware manufacturers—we can strike a better balance between investing in human capital and in equipment. This strategy not only encourages more equitable and innovative research but can also contribute to ensuring a sustainable future for EEG science.</p>

<summary>3.3. Research evaluation</summary>
<p>There are growing concerns about the criteria used to evaluate scientific projects and the promises made in relation to them. Many assessment bodies still rely on narrow metrics—such as journal impact factor or h-index—that fail to capture the breadth and nuance of academic careers. This focus discourages interdisciplinary, collaborative, and open-science approaches.</p>
<p>Adopting broader research evaluation procedures and metrics, as recommended by the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (<a href="https://coara.eu/" target="_blank">CoARA</a>), is key to creating a more open, equitable, and ethically grounded research culture. Criteria that value transparency, data sharing, and open-source development can strengthen the robustness, reliability, and social relevance of scientific findings. Embracing these more comprehensive measures can help foster integrity, encourage collaboration, and ultimately benefit both the scientific community and society at large.</p>

<summary>3.4 Reconsidering Environmental Impact</summary>
<p>The scientific consensus is clear: human activity, including scientific research, profoundly affects Earth’s climate and resources—posing a serious threat to humanity’s future. Scientists, positioned at the forefront of knowledge, have a duty not just to document this crisis but also to alter their research practices accordingly (<a href="../references/#Aron2020">Aron et al., 2020</a>; <a href="../references/#Racimo2022">Racimo et al., 2022</a>; <a href="../references/#Rae2022">Rae et al., 2022</a>; <a href="../references/#Urai2023">Urai &amp; Kelly, 2023</a>). Although EEG and related neuroscience fields may appear less resource-intensive than many other domains, we are still part of a broader infrastructure that depends on finite materials, substantial energy, and complex global supply chains.</p>
<p>Some lines of EEG research offer potential long-term benefits for human health and well-being, but they can also require high-performance computing, extensive travel, or large-scale distribution of equipment (e.g. in population neuroscience). Pursuing such work without critically evaluating, or even considering, environmental costs risks perpetuating a “do it because we can” mentality and may be untenable in the long run. Wider collaborations and resource sharing can lead to synergy effects that reduce the ecological footprint of large scale projects. Moreover, systemic pressures in academia, such as publication demands and grant requirements, may push researchers to pursue expansions in scope without equivalent scrutiny of environmental impact. Achieving genuine sustainability will require confronting these norms, ensuring that EEG studies are not only scientifically rigorous but also responsive to the realities of climate change and resource scarcity. </p>

<summary>3.5 Measuring and reducing the environmental footprint of our work</summary>
<p>While EEG itself generally has a moderate ecological impact, the datasets involved can be very large, and the required storage and computational power used to support EEG sciences continue to expand. Moreover, we need to account for the broader environmental footprint of our professional activities (e.g., conference travel, institutional purchases, and overall infrastructure; see <a href="../references/#Souter2024">Souter et al., 2024</a>, for similar initiative in fMRI).</p>
<p>A key first step is to quantify this impact (see tools examples below). With that knowledge in hand, researchers can identify effective measures to reduce negative outcomes while preserving core scientific aims. However, rebound effects—where well-intentioned actions produce unintended harm—must be carefully monitored to ensure that measures to reduce our carbon footprint do not inadvertently lead to other adverse consequences</p>

<summary>3.6 Using research resources, equipment and data thoughtfully</summary>
<p>While non-invasive EEG often appears low-impact compared to more resource-intensive methods, individual projects can still consume substantial time, funding, and materials—particularly if their design is inefficient or redundant. Consequently, reviewing existing datasets and clarifying genuine methodological advances before embarking on new recordings are essential steps to ensure our collective use of participant time and laboratory resources remains both ethical and environmentally sound. By being judicious about data collection, we both respect our participants and optimize the use of laboratory, computational, and environmental resources.</p>
<p>Further, the production and disposal of scientific equipment contribute significantly to pollution and waste. Encouraging <strong>equipment pooling, and sharing</strong>, or applying the 3Rs approach (“Reduce, Reuse, Recycle” <a href="../references/#Marques2020">Marques &amp; Fritzen Gomes, 2020</a>) in the lab can help reduce the demand for new devices and extend the lifespan of existing ones. By reducing resource usage and waste production, we not only lessen our environmental impact but also encourage a more collaborative and cost-effective research environment.</p>
<p>Likewise, our field generates vast volumes of data, and we bear a responsibility to make sure they are fully utilized. Meta-analyses—where multiple teams aggregate already-collected datasets—also decrease resource usage, strengthen collaboration, and foster more reliable findings (<a href="../references/#Koile2021">Koile &amp; Cristia, 2021</a>). To facilitate sharing and reuse, it is essential to standardize data acquisition and analysis and to manage data according to the FAIR principles <a href="../references/#Wilkinson2016">(Wilkinson et al., 2016)</a>, ensuring that it remains Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (See also Section 1.2).</p>
