  <h1>Democratization</h1>

<h2 id="democratization-the-importance-of-diversity-and-inclusion-to-support-the-development-of-eeg-science">Democratization: the importance of diversity and inclusion to support the development of EEG science</h2>
<p>A key challenge for science is to ensure that research primarily benefits everyone rather than a privileged few, and that it is never weaponized to cause intentional harm <a href="../references/#Carroll2020">(Carroll et al., 2020)</a>. Achieving this goal requires democratizing both research outcomes and the people involved—whether they are scientists, participants, or patients. This means creating an environment where research tools, data, and findings are readily accessible and representative of all, free from gender and geopolitical discrimination, and open to international collaborations. It also entails extending opportunities to institutions and researchers in regions experiencing conflict or crises, especially where advanced platforms for basic and clinical research are present.</p>
<p><strong>Diversity in the scientific community</strong> is very important, we must include individuals from different backgrounds, disciplines, and perspectives to facilitate epistemological diversity (i.e., Who does the science?, <a href="../references/#LaScala2022">La Scala et al., 2022</a>; <a href="../references/#Parada2024">Parada et al., 2024</a>), methodological innovation (i.e., How do we do science?, <a href="../references/#Choy2022">Choy et al., 2022</a>), and the mitigation of risks such as <em>groupthink</em> <a href="../references/#Szanto2016">(Szanto, 2016)</a>. <strong>Diversity in research samples</strong> is key to produce generalizable and ethical scientific findings. Biased participant selection leads to misleading conclusions that, in the worst scenario, might reinforce structural inequalities and outdated beliefs. It is essential to ensure inclusivity in participants, be it age, gender, cultural background, socioeconomic status, and more. This will improve the validity, replicability, and applicability of our research <a href="../references/#Tzovara2021">(Tzovara et al., 2021)</a>. Furthermore, <strong>diversity in applications and outreach</strong> will make our research accessible, relevant, and beneficial to a broader range of communities. Scientific knowledge should be open, but also presented in ways that facilitate the engagement of diverse audiences. If our research cannot be read, understood, and used by non-scientific audiences, does it really <em>exist</em>? Scientific communities should avoid exclusionary language, consider the needs of underrepresented groups, and actively involve other actors such as artists, designers, journalists, and beyond to create bidirectional links involving the communities impacted by our research <a href="../references/#Ishaq2021">(Ishaq et al., 2021)</a>. </p>
<details class="info">
<summary>2.1. Diversity in the scientific community</summary>
<p>Despite gradual progress, workplace discrimination remains a major issue in science <a href="../references/#Woolston2021">(Woolston, 2021)</a>. Enhancing diversity—whether in terms of gender or cultural background—can be both challenging and transformative. Research shows that inclusive teams promote creativity and may even yield stronger scientific outcomes  (<a href="../references/#Diversity2020">Achieving Diversity in Research, 2020</a>; <a href="../references/#AlShebli2018">AlShebli et al., 2018</a>; <a href="../references/#Powell2018">Powell, 2018</a>). Building such teams means not only nurturing an inclusive lab culture, but also ensuring conference participation and networking opportunities reflect a broad range of voices <a href="../references/#Corneyllie2024">(Corneyllie et al., 2024)</a>. </p>
<p>At the same time, well-intentioned diversity initiatives can unintentionally widen global disparities. When institutions and labs in wealthier countries recruit talented researchers from low- and middle-income regions, they may exacerbate “brain drain,” weakening the scientific capacity of those researchers’ home institutions. The pledges below seek to balance benefits for both parties, encouraging ethically responsible collaboration and mindful engagement with underrepresented communities.</p>

<summary>2.2. Diversity in study participants and sample populations</summary>
<p>Mining homogenous, diversity-less datasets -whether it is demographics, experimental paradigms, recording environments- might amplify any existing biases in those datasets. The field of neuroscience has long relied disproportionately on individuals from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic populations (<a href="../references/#Caspar2024">Caspar, 2024</a>; <a href="../references/#Dotson2020">Dotson &amp; Duarte, 2020</a>; <a href="../references/#Henrich2020">Henrich, 2020</a>; <a href="../references/#Muthukrishna2020">Muthukrishna et al., 2020</a>). This overreliance narrows the scope of our findings, undermining the goal of identifying universal principles of brain function. Moreover, systematic exclusion of people —whether due to technical constraints in EEG caps <a href="../references/#Webb2022">(Webb et al., 2022)</a> <a href="../references/#Girolamo2022">(Girolamo et al., 2022)</a> entrenched lab practices, or broader structural racism (<a href="../references/#Choy2022">Choy et al., 2022</a>; <a href="../references/#Parker2022">Parker &amp; Ricard, 2022</a>)—can foster distrust among underrepresented communities and limit the generalizability of research. Crucially, participant diversity should be embraced as a scientifically valuable feature rather than dismissed as “noise.” Recent evidence shows that more inclusive recruitment is not only necessary but also feasible in varied environments, including rural settings in different countries (<a href="../references/#Caspar2024">Caspar, 2024</a>; <a href="../references/#Pech2024">Pech et al., 2024</a>), highlighting the potential for creating truly representative and equitable research populations. </p>
<p>When AI models are trained on datasets that do not reflect the full variability of human cognitive and physiological states, they will encode a narrow, static representation of cognition–one that is detached from the ecological, cultural, and biological diversity shaping real-world neurobehavioral dynamics.</p>

<summary>2.3. Accessibility of research outcomes</summary>
<p>Ensuring that research outcomes—whether new knowledge or potential applications—remain accessible to both the scientific community and the general public is a core ethical responsibility for public funded research. The rise of the open science movement has substantially advanced this goal, aided by open-source software and hardware, DIY (“do-it-yourself”) materials, open knowledge platforms (e.g., Wikipedia), open data repositories, open-access publications, and a wealth of instructional content on video platforms. Underpinned by legal frameworks (e.g., copyleft) and data use agreements that prevent misappropriation or misuse, these initiatives foster transparency and collaboration within clear regulatory boundaries.</p>
<p>However, meaningful access must also address the <strong>inverse care law</strong>, by which those who most need healthcare—including improved brain health—are often least likely to receive it (<a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/publications/world-health-statistics" target="_blank">World Health Statistics</a>). Expanding access to research tools, knowledge, and resources can help reduce inequalities in care, as well as bolster participant diversity (see pledges 2.2) and promote equitable cross-community collaborations (see pledges 2.1). By prioritizing widespread availability, we can ensure that EEG research benefits the broadest spectrum of society, particularly those who stand to gain the most.</p>

I commit to promoting a wide use of my research for the scientific community, and beyond, if applicable. I will do so by:</p>
<ul class="tasklist">
<li>    <input type='checkbox' checked name="pledge_2_3_1" class="data-input" />
    using open and transparent approaches (e.g., preprints, preregistration) responsibly, and to withdrawing deposits that do not yield validated findings or conclusive outcomes.  </li>
<li>    <input type='checkbox' checked name="pledge_2_3_2" class="data-input" />
    developing publicly accessible summaries or visuals of my findings to make the results (and their limitations) understandable and beneficial to broader, non-specialist audiences.  </li>
<li>    <input type='checkbox' checked name="pledge_2_3_3" class="data-input" />
    using research results to inform policies and investments that target health inequalities and under-resourced areas, ensuring that EEG applications reach communities where they are needed most.</li>

<p>Stigma around brain research participation can affect a person's willingness to participate. People may be afraid of public stigma or their own internalized stereotypes about a condition, which can make them less likely to learn about research studies. Also, people may be afraid of discrimination and stigmatization, which can make them less likely to engage with healthcare services or research institutes.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
